IMAD Assignment 2

https://github.com/ST10490405-Nkoka-Ngobeni/IMAD5112-A2.git

I developed a simple educational quiz app to help users test and improve their knowledge of history through a series of true or false questions. Users answer each question by selecting “True” or “False” and receive immediate feedback on their answers. The app tracks the user’s score throughout the quiz and displays a summary with personalized encouragement at the end. Additionally, users can review all the questions and their correct answers to reinforce learning. The app provides an intuitive and engaging way to learn historical facts, making it ideal for students and history enthusiasts alike.

App Features:
1.	True/False Quiz Format
Users answer history-related questions by selecting either True or False.
2.	Immediate Feedback on Answers
After each answer, the app displays "Correct!!" or "Incorrect!!" to inform the user instantly.
3.	Score Tracking
The app keeps track of the user’s current score and displays it after each question.
4.	Question Navigation
Automatically progresses to the next question after a brief delay.
5.	End-of-Quiz Summary
Displays a final message with the user’s total score once all questions are answered.
6.	Conditional Messaging
Shows encouraging messages based on performance — e.g., “Great job!” for scores higher than 3, and “Keep trying!” otherwise.
7.	Review Mode
Allows users to review all questions and their correct answers after completing the quiz.
8.	Exit Option in Review
Provides a button to exit the app cleanly from the review screen.
9.	Persistent Data Transfer Between Screens
Transfers the score and question data between activities for consistent user experience.
10.	User-Friendly UI Controls
Hides answer buttons and question text after quiz completion and only displays the "Next" button to proceed, simplifying the interface.


Utilizing GitHub
To manage our project using Git Bash, we will first close all projects in GitHub, then select the specific app we are working on. This will open the project's files in File Explorer, where we will launch Git Bash. When Git Bash is now open we have to command the following:
1. git init
2. git add.
3. git commit -m "First Commit"
4. git remote add origin <repository_link>
5. git push origin main
6. git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
7. git push origin main
When you're done with the commands you've now have submitted on GitHub
